<h2 style="color: white;" id="cserver"><u>1.Client/Server  concepts</u></h2>
<img src="cserver.png"/>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server. The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.

The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol, which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite.
</p>
<p>
TCP protocol maintains a connection until the client and server have completed the message exchange. TCP protocol determines the best way to distribute application data into packets that networks can deliver, transfers packets to and receives packets from the network, and manages flow control and retransmission of dropped or garbled packets. IP is a connectionless protocol in which each packet traveling through the Internet is an independent unit of data unrelated to any other data units.

Client requests are organized and prioritized in a scheduling system, which helps servers cope in the instance of receiving requests from many distinct clients in a short space of time. The client-server approach enables any general-purpose computer to expand its capabilities by utilizing the shared resources of other hosts. Popular client-server applications include email, the World Wide Web, and network printing.
</p>
<h4 style="color: white;"><u>Client-Server Network</u></h3>
<img src="csnetwork.png" width="450" height="250">
<p>
&emsp;A client-server network is the medium through which clients access resources and services from a central computer, via either a local area network (LAN) or a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet. A unique server called a daemon may be employed for the sole purpose of awaiting client requests, at which point the network connection is initiated until the client request has been fulfilled.

Network traffic is categorized as client-to-server (north-south traffic) or server-to-server (east-west traffic). Popular network services include e-mail, file sharing, printing, and the World Wide Web. A major advantage of the client-server network is the central management of applications and data.

<h3 style="color: white;" id="components"><u>Components  of  Web  Application</u></h3>
<img src="components.png" width="650" height="400"/>
<p>&emsp;Web application architecture is a blueprint of simultaneous interactions between components, databases, middleware systems, user interfaces, and servers in an application. It can also be described as the layout that logically defines the connection between the server and client-side for a better web experience.
</p>
<p>
Any web application, big or small, contains these major components:
<br/>
<b>View Layer:-</b> When you consider an MVC application, the View layer component gives an interface to the application. Regardless if it is for users with a browser or for another application using Web services. View layer is the bridge for getting the data in and out of the application.

It does not have business logic, like calculating interest for a banking application or storing items in a shopping cart for an online catalog. It also does not contain any code for existing data or retrieving data from a data source. Business logic is managed by the Model layer. The view layer is more focused on the interface.
<br/>
<b>Business Layer:</b>- It is also known as Business Logic or Domain Logic or Application Layer. The function of the business layer is to accept user requests from the browser, process them, and determine the routes through which the data will be accessed. The workflows by which the data and requests travel through the back end lay encoded in a business layer.
<br/>
<b>Data Access Layer:-</b> This layer is built to keep the code you use to pull data from your data store like database, flat files, or web services separate from business logic and presentation code. So even if you have to change data stores, you don’t end up rewriting the whole thing.

There are many ORM frameworks that are blending the DAL with other layers which makes development easy during web application development services.
<br/>
<b>Error handling, security, logging:-</b> When you build a web application, people generally tend to focus on the end-goal, building, and testing only for situations when things go right. Alas! things rarely go right all the time in the real world.
<br/>
This is where error handling is a vital part of any application’s user experience. And, if it is done well, it can leave your users feeling informed and properly considered.

<h3 style="color: white;" id="contenttype"><u>Types  of Web Content</u></h3>
<p>
&emsp;Here are 7 types of high-quality web content that can please website visitors and keep them coming back for more:
<br/><br/>
<b>1. Blogs</b><br/>

&emsp;Blogging is an invaluable tool for driving visitors to your website, and building awareness about you and your brand.

Generally written from a more personal and informal point of view than content assets, a blog is a great way to connect with readers. It is the perfect vehicle for providing them with information that not only answers a question or solves a problem, but also helps to establish you as a trusted authority on the topic.

Blogs are also a great way to keep your web content fresh, enabling you to post new content on a regular basis and helping you continue to rank in SERPs (search results).
<br/>
<b>2. Content assets</b><br/>

&emsp;This broad category of web content includes collateral and similar resources you have already invested in and can now repurpose to help draw visitors to your website.

Some examples are product brochures, user manuals, slide presentations, white papers, industry reports, case studies, fact sheets, ebooks, webinars, and podcasts.

The goal is to extend the value of these assets by using them across different digital media and channels. The content can be broken up into smaller pieces and distributed in new ways, such as via blog posts, tweets, video clips, email blasts, search engine ads, and other channels.
<br/>
<b>3. Calls to action</b><br/>

&emsp;A call to action (CTA) is a prompt designed to get your website visitor to take some immediate action, such as make a purchase or get more information.
A CTA may take your web visitor to a landing page for further action.

Whatever your CTA is, it is important that the intent is clear and your audience has a good idea what to expect. After all, you don’t want lose visitors by having them click on a link that takes them somewhere they really don’t want to go.
<br/>
<b>4. Landing pages</b><br/>

&emsp;Landing pages are destinations — the web pages where visitors are sent when they click on a hyperlink, such as a search engine result, a social media ad, a CTA, or a special offer on your website.

These pages are designed to help you convert website visitors into leads by providing a way to capture their contact information.

For example, suppose you want to build your authority as an SME by offering a free white paper to your website visitors. When they click on the offer link, it can take them to a landing page where the content of white paper is described in more detail and they can download the paper by submitting an email address.
<br/>
<b>5. Testimonials</b><br/>

&emsp;One of the best ways to appeal to prospects and build credibility is with relatable success stories from their peers. That is what makes customer testimonials such valuable web content.

Whether your goal is to create formal case studies, include real-life customer scenarios in a white paper, or post short video clips on Twitter or Facebook, having a process in place to identify happy customers and capture their feedback is a great idea.

TIP: Don’t hide all your valuable customer feedback on one testimonials page. Include testimonials throughout your site to serve as social proof that validates your claims.
<br/>
<b>6. Video & audio content</b><br/>

&emsp;With the ability to embed video and audio clips so that anyone can view and listen without leaving the webpage, digitally recorded media are increasingly popular web content tools. It is a great way to offer content such as how-tos, webinars, podcasts, and seminars.
<br/>
<b>7. Visual content</b><br/>

&emsp;According to the Social Science Research Network, 65% of people are visual learners. So, it makes good sense to incorporate visual web content into your website.

<h3 style="color: white;" id="http"><u>An overview of HTTP</u></h3>
<p>&emsp;HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.
</p>
<img src="http.png" width=650 height=400>
<p>
HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example, a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.

Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer called the response. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called proxies, which perform different operations and act as gateways or caches

<br/>

<h3 style="color: white;" id="dynamic"><u>Generation of dynamic webpages</u></h3>
<p>A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.

A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model, or DOM, to query page state and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there isn't any server-side code included.
</p>
<img src="dynamic.png" width=750 height=400>
<p>
A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using AJAX technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using AJAX, the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The AJAX engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server.

<h3 style="color: white;" id="appserver"><u>Applicatin Server</u></h3>
<p>An application server is a server that hosts applications.

Application server frameworks are software frameworks for building application servers. An application server framework provides both facilities to create web applications and a server environment to run them.

An application server framework contains a comprehensive service layer model. It includes a set of components accessible to the software developer through a standard API defined for the platform itself. For Web applications, these components usually run in the same environment as their web server(s), and their main job is to support the construction of dynamic pages. However, many application servers do more than generate web pages: they implement services such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing, so developers can focus on implementing the business logic.

In the case of Java application servers, the server behaves like an extended virtual machine for running applications, transparently handling connections to the database on one side, and, often, connections to the Web client on the other
</p>

</center>
<p>
An application server runs behind a web Server (e.g. Apache or Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)) and (almost always) in front of an SQL[citation needed] database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle). Web applications are computer code which run atop application servers and are written in the language the application server supports and call the runtime libraries and components the application server offers.

Many application servers exist. The choice impacts the cost, performance, reliability, scalability, and maintainability of a web application.

Proprietary application servers provide system services in a well-defined but proprietary manner. The application developers develop programs according to the specification of the application server. Dependence on a particular vendor is the drawback of this approach.

An opposite but analogous case is the Java EE platform. Java EE application servers provide system services in a well-defined, open, industry standard. The application developers develop programs according to the Java EE specification and not according to the application server. A Java EE application developed according to Java EE standard can be deployed in any Java EE application server making it vendor-independent.

<h3 style="color: white;" id="security"><u>Web Security</u></h3>
<p>Web application security is a central component of any web-based business. The global nature of the Internet exposes web properties to attack from different locations and various levels of scale and complexity. Web application security deals specifically with the security surrounding websites, web applications and web services such as APIs.
</p>

<p>
Attacks against web apps range from targeted database manipulation to large-scale network disruption. Let’s explore some of the common methods of attack or “vectors” commonly exploited.
<br/>
    <b>&emsp;Cross site scripting (XSS)</b> - XSS is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into a webpage in order to access important information directly, impersonate the user, or trick the user into revealing important information.
  <br/>  <b>&emsp;SQL injection (SQi)</b> - SQi is a method by which an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the way a database executes search queries. Attackers use SQi to gain access to unauthorized information, modify or create new user permissions, or otherwise manipulate or destroy sensitive data.
  <br/>  <b>&emsp;Denial-of-service (DoS)</b> and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks - Through a variety of vectors, attackers are able to overload a targeted server or its surrounding infrastructure with different types of attack traffic. When a server is no longer able to effectively process incoming requests, it begins to behave sluggishly and eventually deny service to incoming requests from legitimate users.
  <br/>  <b>&emsp;Memory corruption</b> - Memory corruption occurs when a location in memory is unintentionally modified, resulting in the potential for unexpected behavior in the software. Bad actors will attempt to sniff out and exploit memory corruption through exploits such as code injections or buffer overflow attacks.
</p>
<p>
 website using HTTPS is like a restaurant displaying a "Pass" from the local food safety inspector: potential customers can trust that they can patronize the business without experiencing massively negative effects. And in this day and age, using HTTP is essentially like displaying a "Fail" food safety inspection sign: there's no guarantee that something terrible won't happen to a customer.

HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt communications so that attackers can't steal data. SSL/TLS also confirms that a website server is who it says it is, preventing impersonations. This stops multiple kinds of cyber attacks (just like food safety prevents illness).

Even though some users may be unaware of the benefits of SSL/TLS, modern browsers are making sure they're aware of the trustworthiness of a website no matter what.
